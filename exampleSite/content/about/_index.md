I’m a UI/UX Product Designer with a strong foundation in problem solving and visual design. I'm passionate about designing solutions using a human-centered design thinking approach. My interest lies in empowering and applying my skills and methods to serve underrepresented communities by tackling social and civic issues.

When I’m not designing, you can find me mentoring designers trying to break into the industry, dancing and experimenting with vegan recipes.
