#### Your work and you: A love-hate relationship ([DesignThinkers](https://designthinkers.com/))

November 9, 2020 - Attaching ourselves to work is something we do, but it's often not discussed. We enjoy work immensely when it is going well and hate it when it isn't. It's a never-ending roller-coaster. In this talk, I share my own roller-coaster ride to remind us we're not traveling alone on the journey that is our careers. I offered pointers along the way for how best to experience and succeed at it. 


#### Rapid problem solving in Product Design ([SheHacks Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHXpPQA7Je8))
January 9, 2021 - This workshop focused on teaching students how to solve a product design problem given a short amount of time. It equipped them with the right tools and thinking to be able to tackle a whiteboarding challenge in product design interviews. My responsibilities beyond teaching the workshop, consisted of grading and judging the best overall hack at the hackathon.
