#### Problem

Customers were finding it difficult to navigate and find the answers they were looking for. Originally, our contact us page would lead you to the FAQs, which wasn’t intuitive nor easy to navigate.

Contact Us page is our first line of defense prior to a customer calling in. It’s a place where customers can self-serve and get answers to their questions quickly rather than waiting on a call.

#### What is the goal?

* Encourage self-servicing to help reduce call volume.
* Present only relevant information to customers.
* Organize information based on importance in an accessible and digestible format.

#### Needs Statement

We want to help customers and pre-customers answer their questions and solve their problems by providing a fast, seamless and relevant experience so they can get back to their daily life.

We led a design workshop to help us generate ideas collectively and quickly, as well as paper prototype.

This was tested with users for ease of use and feedback. We took the feedback from users and stakeholders, iterated and incorporated it into our final design to simplify it further. We were able to test it again, and customers found it easier to navigate and find information. The [responsive view of the contact us page](https://bit.ly/39Gepwy) was also taken into consideration and tested with mobile users.

#### Next Steps

Another problem with this page was the content itself, it wasn’t very helpful and sometimes difficult to understand. It required a rewrite. The future state is to have a support page that will ultimately replace the contact us and FAQs. The information will be crowd-sourced internally, and we’re working with copywriters to simplify the language and replace the financial lingo.
