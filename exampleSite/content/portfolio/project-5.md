### Context

[Kaur Space](https://kaurspace.com/) was created to show the world that it is possible to #WorkDifferently by unlearning and relearning how to live an integrated life filled with work wellness and impact. The current challenges the company was facing were:

* They have a product but the direction they are moving towards ( educational content + vision around #WorkingDifferently) does not align with the product being offered.
* The growth rate for the past 5 months has been -0.82% and 1.2% conversion rate.
* The solution was created without data and customer validation of the problem.

### Problem

People are feeling overworked, tired, and lost in the world of work. They have experienced burnout or currently in the storm of burnout and donâ€™t know what recovery looks like or how to start building a work life that works for them.

To address the challenges and problem statement, we met with the stakeholders and held a Design Sprint to identify the scope and needs of the customers.

Together we determined the scope of the project by coming up with an MVP which comprised of the main actions the user can take either as a driver or hiker. I was responsible for the visual design of the app, illustration and layout.

I was responsible for designing the layout using the brand guidelines, and built out the working prototype on Invision for user testing. We implemented user feedback along with the company stakeholder feedback into the final designs.
