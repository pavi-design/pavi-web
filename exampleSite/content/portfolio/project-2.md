#### Project Details

Developing a compelling brand and online experience for a purpose-built assisted living residential home for the elderly.

Working in collaboration with Takahashi Legend Care, I designed the brand identity, logo and website for the home. The purpose was to promote and introduce the new home to residents. As a result, the created tools reflect the caring approach of Takahashi Legend Care while engaging new residents to enroll.

I helped create the Takahashi Legend Care identity – starting with a brand strategy that reflected the caring and supportive environment in the home. I used imagery and colours to launch a new identity that helps new residents feel that they’re in their own homes.
